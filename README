CXSBS: Canonical eXtensible SauerBraten Server
By: Morgan Borman

CXSBS is a total restructuring of the python side of the XSBS project.

XSBS is a great project and I salute Greg Haynes (https://github.com/greghaynes) for the tremendous amount of work he and the 
others involved in the XSBS project spent to get it to where it is.

That said, design is an iterative process and in working on XSBS I have seen many things which
will benefit greatly from this restructuring.

The goals of this restructuring process are as follows:
	Completely modularize the plugin architecture, turning everything into a plugin which have version dependencies on eachother
	Canonicalize the plugin structure to better support advanced operations like reloading server configurations.
	Promote a better documented and more maintainable sauerbraten server mod.
	Provide a feature complete server for single and multiple instance applications.
